## 📂 Module Contents

### 🟢 Week 1: Variables & Math
* **Focus:** Introduction to C++, variables, math, and standard output.
* **Logic:** Begins as a simple 'Hello World!' application, before getting more complex.

### 🟢 Week 2: Logic Comparisons
* **Standard Task:** Implementation of relational operators and `if/else` conditional statements to handle basic logic flow.
* **Advanced Task:** Complex Boolean logic and nested conditionals designed to validate multiple player/system states simultaneously.

### 🟢 Week 3: Loops & Arrays
* **Focus:** Mastering `for` and `while` loops alongside 1D arrays.
* **Logic:** Systems created to iterate through data sets, such as calculating averages or managing scores in a simulated game environment.
